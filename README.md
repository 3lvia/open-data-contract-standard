# Template for Data Contract

Welcome! Thanks for your interest and for taking the time to come here! ❤️

## Executive summary
This project describes the data contract being used in the implementation of Data Mesh at [PayPal](https://about.pypl.com/). It is available for you as an Apache 2.0 license. Contributions are welcome!

## What is a Data Contract?
A data contract defines the agreement between a data producer and consumer. A data contract contains several sections:
* Fundamentals.
* Schema.
* Data quality.
* Service-level agreement (SLA).
* Security & stakeholders.
* Custom properties.

## How do we use Data Contracts at PayPal?
PayPal uses data contracts in many way, but this [article](https://medium.com/paypal-tech/the-next-generation-of-data-platforms-is-the-data-mesh-b7df4b825522) from the [PayPal Technology blog](https://medium.com/paypal-tech) gives a good introduction.
